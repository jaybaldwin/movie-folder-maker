# Movie Folder Maker

## Introduction

In February of 2018, I switched my movie catalog / collection management to Radarr, which required movies have their own 
folder, because it is a fork of Sonarr, which is the same software, but for TV shows.  

After creating folders manually for 8-10 shows, I said "no" and made this .NET console app in C# instead.
